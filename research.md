I am a cosmologist, whose aim is to answer fundamental physics questons like what is our Universe made of, what is the nature of dark matter and dark energy, how did galaxies and all other structures in the Universe came to be. To answer these questions, one requires analytical, numerical and statistical models

My research focuses on understanding the connection between the initial conditions of the Universe, just after the Big Bang, and the overarching large-scale structure observed by telescopes today. As a cosmologist, the aim is to answer fundamental physics questons like what is our Universe made of, what is the nature of dark matter and dark energy, how did galaxies and all other structures in the Universe came to be. Understanding these mysterious aspects of our cosmos requires a combination of physical insight, numerical simulations and analytical work.


I use machine-learning techniques to help us gain insights into the physics of cosmological structure formation.

We trained a machine learning algorithm to infer the relationship between the initial conditions and the final dark matter haloes in an N-body simulation. The aim was to gain insights into the physics driving halo formation by evaluating the predictive performance of the algorithm when provided with different types of information about the local environment around dark matter particles. We found that the tidal shear field carries very little information compared to spherical overdensities, in constrast to standard interpretation of classical ellipsoidal collapse theories of halo formation such as Sheth-Tormen theory.
