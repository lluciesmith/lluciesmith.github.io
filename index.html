								I am a Junior Professor at the <a href="https://www.physik.uni-hamburg.de/en/hs.html">Hamburg Observatory</a> at the University of Hamburg in Germany. 
								
								My research work focuses on studying how galaxies and large-scale structures of the Universe form and finding ways to extract fundamental physics from them, using a combination of numerical simulations and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. In particular, I have been developing explainable AI models which, contrary to traditional ``black-box'' machine learning models, allow us to interpret what the algorithms have learnt and explain them in terms of the underlying physics.

								I care a lot about diversity and inclusivity in academia, and I was the organizer of the Welfare and Equity Group at MPA. I also love to talk about fun and mysterious aspects of our Universe to the public, so feel free to <a href="{{ "/contact/" | relative_url }}">contact me</a> about public outreach events.
							</p>

								I started my academic path at Imperial College London, working with <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.rajantie">Prof. Arttu Rajantie</a>, on the production of a gravitational wave background during the epoch of reheating. I then did my PhD at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/astrophysics/">University College London</a> (UCL) on <a href="https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10090888/"><i>Insights into cosmological structure formation with machine learning</i></a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/people/hiranya.peiris">Prof. Hiranya Peiris</a> and <a href="https://www.pontzen.co.uk">Prof. Andrew Pontzen</a>. During my PhD, I spent six months at the <a href="https://www.fnal.gov">Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory</a> in the USA, funded by the <a href="https://www.ura-hq.org">University Research Association</a> to work on a project on deep learning applications to cosmology.
								I stayed at UCL for a one-year postdoctoral research position after I completed my PhD, working in the <a href="https://gmgalaxies.org">GMGalaxies</a> research group led by Andrew Pontzen. I then moved to Germany as a postdoctoral Research Fellow at the <a href="https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de">Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics</a> (MPA) in Garching, Germany where I spent four years. In November 2024, I moved to the Hamburg Observatory at Hamburg University as a Junior Professor to start my own research group.
